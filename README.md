# linkd-list

#### An experiment in buliding a personal linktree alternative hosted on github pages.

---

After fighting with a hideously unresponsive admin panel, getting auto logged out several times, being unable to alter my handle and having many customizability options locked behind a subscription, I decided it'd be easier just to build my own simpler version of linktr.ee with a fraction of the functionality (I just want a page with links).

As long as you aren't interested in a fancy admin panel and some of the extra services that linktr.ee has to offer in their subscription tier, creating a static page of links with basic css styling that can be hosted for free on github pages is about as easy as projects come.

Feel free to clone and edit as you wish!
